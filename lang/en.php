    <h3>Product, specialty coffee from Colombia</h3>
    <p>Two varieties of coffee are identified in the world, the Arabic and the robust; the former are characterized by their aroma and acidity and, on the other hand, the latter by their robustness; the arabica species represents 80% of world production and is cultivated in Central American countries, Colombia, Brazil, India and some African countries, such as Kenya and Ethiopia. Most Robusta coffee is grown in Africa, Indonesia and Brazil. In the world market, the quality of Colombian coffee is recognized and estimated as one of the best among the 37 Arabic coffees. Coffee arrived in Colombia in the 18th century to the Santander region and from there it moved to Antioquia, Tolima, Caldas, Valle del Cauca, Risaralda, Quindío, Cundinamarca and Nariño, which are the departments where most of the coffee is located today. of the growers. The quality of the coffee drink depends on many factors: genetic origin, latitude, altitude, climate of the place of cultivation, sanitary care, agronomic practices, coffee culture, quality of the harvest, type and control during the processes of benefit, threshing, storage, roasting and beverage preparation. There are also differences in the preferences and quality expected by coffee consumers; For example, the French and Italians prefer a drink with high bitterness and body, while the Germans like a drink with high acidity and aroma and moderate body. There are differences between the quality of the coffee according to the type of mill: wet-processed coffee, such as Colombian coffee, is classified as "soft wash" due to its moderate bitterness, body, acidity and pronounced aromas; on the other hand, the robusta type coffee processed by the dry route, which is produced in Brazil, differs by its greater body and bitterness (Puerta Quintero, 2011). Since 1996, the National Federation of Coffee Growers has led the Colombian specialty coffee program, with the aim of identifying and selecting coffees with exceptional characteristics, from specific regions. In addition, three fundamental concepts are integrated: environmental conservation, economic equity and social responsibility. According to studies carried out for Cenicafe (Farfán Valencia, 2014), the Colombian product is identified by 38 characteristics of moderate body and high acidity in a balanced way to achieve a particular quality of smoothness in the drink.</p><br>
